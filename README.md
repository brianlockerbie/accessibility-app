<p align="center"><b>Module #1 HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor</b></p>

<p><b>Description:</b> For this project I was given starter code for a marketing agency's website that  needed code refactoring to make their website more accessibile. I added web accessibility to the website that ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies. This also adds better positioning in search engines for the site when it is more accessible.</p>
